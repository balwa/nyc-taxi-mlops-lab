"""S2: training_set, trained_model, eval_report, the challenger gate and the challenger asset.

- training_set: UNLOAD a window of staging.trip_features (and the holdout month) to the artifact bucket.
  The zone-pair distance lookup (contracts/features.yaml, est_distance_miles) comes from the window only.
- trained_model: fit tripmodel.LightGBMModel (the given v2), log it to MLflow as a pyfunc with
  tripmodel.model_signature() and the tripmodel package bundled, register a version of the model named
  in contracts/mlflow.yaml, and tag it as that contract says.
- eval_report: tripmodel.evaluate the new version and the champion (or the v1 baseline before there is
  one) on the same holdout; log the metrics.
- A blocking check that guards a `challenger` asset, which sets the alias. The pipeline never moves
  `champion`.
Decision points: what stays in the notebook; the promotion metric and margin; the training window.
